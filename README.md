🚗 Electric Vehicle Range Prediction
📘 Overview

This project aims to predict the driving range of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using their technical specifications such as battery capacity, motor power, efficiency, and vehicle weight.
By applying machine learning regression techniques, the project helps estimate how far an EV can travel on a full charge — assisting manufacturers, researchers, and buyers in evaluating EV performance.

🧠 Objective

To build and evaluate a machine learning model that accurately predicts the EV range based on key technical attributes.

⚙️ Methodology

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, normalize numeric features, and encode categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understand relationships between features and EV range.

Feature Selection – Identify important variables like battery size, weight, and efficiency.

Model Training – Use regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Model Evaluation – Compare models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² score.

📈 Expected Outcome
